# PortfolioProject-Data-Cleaning-Protfolio-Project-Queries.sql



This case study focuses on data cleaning techniques using SQL queries. The dataset used for this project 
contains over 56,000 rows of data on the Nashville housing market between 2013 and 2016, and is available on Kaggle.

To clean and prepare the data for analysis, we have performed the following tasks:

1- Standardized the date format across all rows.

2- Filled in NULL values in certain columns to ensure that all data is complete and accurate.

3- Split the addresses into separate columns for easier readability.

4- Removed duplicate rows to ensure that the data is unique and accurate.

5- Deleted unwanted columns that are not relevant to our analysis.

Through this process, we have gained valuable experience in applying data cleaning techniques to real-world data,
 and have prepared the dataset for further analysis. The final product is a clean and well-structured dataset that
 is ready for further analysis and exploration.
