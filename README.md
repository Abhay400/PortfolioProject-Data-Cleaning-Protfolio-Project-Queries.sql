This case study showcases the importance of data cleaning in preparing datasets for accurate analysis. By using SQL queries, we were able to apply a variety of techniques to standardize, fill in missing values, split columns, remove duplicates, and delete unwanted columns.

To clean and prepare the data for analysis, we have performed the following tasks:

1-Standardizing date format enabled accurate comparisons across all data rows.

2-Filling in NULL values was essential to ensure a complete and accurate dataset for meaningful analysis.

3-Splitting addresses into separate columns improved readability and allowed for more detailed exploration of the data.

4-Removing duplicate rows was crucial in ensuring dataset uniqueness and accuracy, which is particularly important in financial data analysis.

5-Deleting unwanted columns focused the analysis on the most relevant data.

6-Data cleaning techniques improve dataset quality and preparation for accurate analysis.

7-A clean and well-structured dataset facilitates more accurate analysis and saves time and resources in the long run.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data cleaning techniques can be applied to real-world datasets to improve their 
quality and prepare them for analysis. A clean and well-structured dataset not only facilitates more accurate analysis
but also saves time and resources in the long run.
